# Gloomy Weather

Gloomy Weather generates background ambient sounds ranging from soothing rain, rumbling and crashing thunder, moving train, chirping birds, waves by the beach and many more. You can mix and match various sounds and audio levels to get the ideal combination to help you relax, sleep, focus or just to drown out bothersome noise from your environment.

You can create an account to save and edit your own presets (combination of sounds and volume) and also view, listen and copy presets made by others.
